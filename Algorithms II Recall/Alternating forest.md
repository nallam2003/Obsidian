Every root is unmatched. every path from a root to its children is an alternating path.

We call a vertex even or odd depending on how many edges-away it is from its tree's root.

Given a set of unmatched vertices $R$, we call an alternating forest **maximum for** $R$ if $R$ are the roots of the forest and every other vertex exists in the forest only if there exists an alternating path between itself and $R$.
