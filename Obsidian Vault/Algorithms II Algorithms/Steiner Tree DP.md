First, we want to transform the input such that every vertex that needs to be in the tree is guaranteed to be a leaf (degree $1$). 

We do this by creating a twin for each vertex $v \in K$, and connecting each pair of twins by and edge of weight $0$. This transformed graph is called $(G',K')$. 

**Claim:** $T$ is a solution to the [[Steiner Tree]] problem for $(G,k)$ $\iff$ $T' = T \cap \{ (v,v ') | v \in K \}$ is a solution of the [[Steiner Tree]] problem for $(G',K')$ where $w(T) = w(T')$. 

**Proof:**

If $T$ is a [[Steiner Tree]] for $G$, then it contains all the vertices in $K$. So, $T'$ would be a [[Steiner Tree]], too, and it contains all the vertices in $K$. If we were to remove all vertices in $K'$ from $T'$ to get $T'[v]$, then $T'[v]$ would be a tree that contains all vertices in $K$, which would make it a [[Steiner Tree]] of $K$, still.

$w(T) = w(T')$ because all the edges between twins are of weight $0$.

**A Steiner tree for $K$ may NOT be composed of Steiner trees of its subsets**

We shall instead consider all subsets $K'$ of $K$ paired with a vertex $v \in V - K$.
