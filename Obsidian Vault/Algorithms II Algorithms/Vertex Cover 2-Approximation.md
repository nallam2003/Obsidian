In a maximal matching $M$ of $G$, every vertex in $G$ covers at most one vertex in $M$. Therefore, we need at least $|M|$ vertices to be in a [[Vertex Cover]] of $G$. 

A simple $2$-[[Approximation]] simply adds the two vertices of every edge in $M$ to the [[Vertex Cover]], thus yielding a [[Vertex Cover]] of size $2|M|$.
