A $c$-approximation algorithm for a some instance $I$ of a problem with objective function $f$ computes a solution $S$ to that problem such that $f(S) \leq c \cdot OPT(I)$ where $OPT(I)$ is the objective function value of an optimal solution on $I$ (assuming maximization here).

To prove that an algorithm is a $c$-approximation, we show that $f(S) \leq u$ where $u$ is some upper bound on $OPT(I)$ (again, assuming maximization).
