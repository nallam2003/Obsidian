A [[Branching]] algorithm makes $O(c^n)$ recursive calls where $b$ is the maximum of the [[Branching vector]] and $c$ is the smallest real root of $x^b - \sum_{i - 1}6{t}x^{b - bi}$ ($c$ is called the [[Branching]] number).

Checkout the v[[Vertex Cover Branching]] algorithm for an example of its usage.
