Given an [[NP-Hard]] problem that can be expressed as an ILP, we find a feasible solution to the [[Dual]] of its LP relaxation. 

Thanks to [[Weak Duality]], we this feasible solution tells us that a feasible solution to the ILP will always be some factor $c$ away from an optimal solution of the problem.
