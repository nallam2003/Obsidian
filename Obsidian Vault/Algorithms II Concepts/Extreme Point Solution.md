An extreme point solution of an LP is one that exists in the "corner" of the feasible region. It is not necessarily possible to find it in polynomial time using the Simplex algorithm. But we can find it efficiently if we already have an arbitrary optimal solution. 

It **CANNOT** be written as a linear combination of two feasible solutions.
