While it is not as simple as the [[Vertex Cover Half-Integrality]], we can still find a half-integral solution for the multiway vertex cut problem.

Let $\tilde{x}$ be an optimal fractional solution, and let $R_{i}$ be the **region** of vertices **whose solution is $\tilde{x}_{v = 0}$,** reachable from terminal $t_{i}$. Lastly, let $B_{i}$ be the set of vertices reachable from vertices in $R_{i}$.

Lastly lastly, let $Q_{1}$ be all the vertices that exist in exactly one boundary while $Q_{2}$ is all the **vertices that exist in more than one boundary.**
