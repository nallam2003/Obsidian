The network consisting of either 

- The edge $(x,y)$ existing and $f_{(x,y)} < c_{(x,y)}$
- The edge $(y,x)$ not necessarily existing, but $(x,y)$ existing and $f_{(y,x)}  > 0$ being true.

In other words, either the edge $(x,y)$ is not used to its full capacity, or its opposite-direction edge having a non-zero flow.
