**Problem: Given a universe $U$ and a collection $\mathcal{S}$ of subsets such that $\bigcup_{S \in \mathcal{S}} = U$, the set cover is a subset $C$ of $\mathcal{S}$ such that $\bigcup_{S \in C} = U$. We may aim to find either:**

- A minimum-weight set cover where $w_{S}$ is some weight value assigned to the set $S$.
- A minimum-size set cover.

**We will mainly focus on the minimum-weight problem as the minimum-size problem is just a special case of it.**
